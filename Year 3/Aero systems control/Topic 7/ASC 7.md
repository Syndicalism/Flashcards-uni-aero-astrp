What is this, what does it relate to and how can it be used?

$$ \begin{align}
e_{ss} &= \lim_{s\to0} sE(s) \\ &= \lim_{s\to0} sR(s) \left[1-\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\right] \\ &= \lim_{s\to0}  \frac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- They are different forms of the final value theorem, which can be used to find steady state error!
- Error can be thought of the difference between the controller input and the response

- Each form is simply a rearrangement of $E$
