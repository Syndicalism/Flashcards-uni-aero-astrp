- Use supercritical foil geometry. The purpose of these is 2 fold:
- Increase the value of [[2D CFD for supersonic airfoil examples|critical Mach number]] to increase $M_{\infty}$ required for wave drag to occur
- Decrease the strength of shocks that do occur
- This is achieved through this flattening of the airfoil's top.

Other than foils, how can transonic and supersonic efficiency be increased?

Back: 
- Wing [[wing sweep|sweep]]
	- Effective oncoming Mach number is $M_{\infty}\cos \beta$, where $\beta$ is the leading edge sweep angle
	- Used in transonic and supersonic regions to reduce the effective Mach number seen by the airfoil section

- Area rule
	- The are rule is where we maintain a smooth stream wise variation of total cross sectional area of the vehicle:
	- Doing so means that the total air compression around the vehicle can vary in a smoother manor, reducing shocks and hence entropy increases.
