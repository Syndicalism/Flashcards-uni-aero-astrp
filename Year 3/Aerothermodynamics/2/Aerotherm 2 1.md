 here:
 $\theta=$ Shock angle, the path of the streamline for most problems we take this as the angle of the objects surface
 $\beta=$ Turning angle ,the angle of the oblique shock

What does the following equation describe, what name each of it's variables:

$$\begin{align*}   \tan\theta&= 2 \frac{1}{\tan\beta} \left[\frac{M_{1}^{2} \sin^{2}\beta - 1 }{M_{1}^{2}(\gamma + \cos 2\beta)+2}\right]   \end{align*}$$

Back: 
- This equation describes the relationship between an oblique shocks turning angle and shock's angle. Both angles are taken tangentially to $M_{1}$.

- $M=$ Mach number before and after shock 
- $\theta=$ oblique shock turning angle
- $\beta=$ oblique shock shock angle

\end{align} $$

Back: 
- This equation describes how the Mach number changes across a oblique shock

- $M=$ Mach number before and after shock

How do you find the $\beta$ of an oblique shock?

Back: 
- You don't try and use the equation since it cant be inversed, instead use a method involving the NST
- You instead interpolate from the Oblique shock chart, finding the shock-wave angle $(\beta)$ which corresponds to your known deflection angle and Mach

How do you find the Mach across a normal shock, given you know shock angle, turning angle and initial Mach number?

Back: 
- First you get the NORMAL component of the incident Mach velocity vector
$$ \begin{align}
M_{n1} &= M_{1} \sin \beta
\end{align} $$
- Then look up the NORMAL component in the normal shock table, noting the $M_{2}$ (interpolating if needed) this $M_{2}$ will be your $M_{n2}$
- Get the actual $M_{2}$ using geometric relationships:
$$ \begin{align}
M _{2} &= \frac{M _{n2}}{\sin (\beta-\theta)}
\end{align} $$

M_{n1} &= M_{1} \sin \beta

What is this chart called, state the obvious 4 key observations:

![[Pasted image 20231117003111.png]]

Back: 
This is the oblique shock chart.

- If $\theta<\theta_{max}$ there area 2 solutions for any valid turning angle
- At zero turning angle they have a normal shock solution as well as some $\beta\neq90\degree$ solution.
- The maximum turning angle (at $M=\infty$) is $45\degree$ with high Mach numbers tending towards this value
- There exists a maximum possible turning angle for any Mach number $\theta_{max}$

What do the coloured lines mean?

![[Pasted image 20231117002729.png]]

Back: 
- The red line describes where we have strong or weak solutions, with those that have $\beta$ angles above $\theta_{max}$ being strong solutions and those below being weak solutions
- The dotted blue line separates where oblique shocks will cause subsonic flow transition, those above will have $M_{2}<1$ while those below will have $M_{2}>1$

What is the tan equation for Mach angle?

Back:

- From this diagram it can be easily derived:
$$ \begin{align}
\tan \mu &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^{2}-1}}

Derive the equation for Mach angle, state it's relationship it oblique shocks.

Back:

- From this diagram:
$$ \begin{align}
\sin\mu &= \frac{3a\Delta t}{3V\Delta t} = \frac{1}{M}
\end{align} $$

- It can be seen that in this derivation the velocity remains straight to the freestream, hence $\theta_{0}=\theta_{1}=0$
- Recalling the implications for oblique shocks:
$$ \begin{align}
\sin\beta  = \frac{1}{M}
\end{align} $$
