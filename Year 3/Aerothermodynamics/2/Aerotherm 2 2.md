What is the idealised reasoning for using oblique shocks inside of intakes?

Back: 
- Efficiency gains
- For an oblique shock the larger the change in Mach number, the larger the stagnation pressure loss. 
- This effect follows a non-linear exponential-ish curve, in an idealised system we can increase efficiency by using many smaller oblique shocks rather than single large ones. 
- EXTRA (Of course in non-idealised systems such as those in real life, other trade offs would also take consideration leading to some optimal shock configuration rather than just adding more forever)

Under what conditions do detached shocks occur?

Back: 
- Looking at the oblique shock chart, you can see that $\theta>\theta_{max}$ has no valid solutions. But obviously something must exist there, the shock phenomena that occurs in this range is known as a detached shock.

Describe the general shape of a detached shock and a brief outline of it's exit Mach numbers and shock angle.

- As the name describes, they are often detached
- In the centre is a infinitesimally small normal shock, here crossing flow is subsonic
- Around the normal shock it is a gradual increasing shock angle, it slowly transitions out from subsonic back into supersonic as you leave the centre
- The crossing Mach number approaches the value in the free stream as the shock angle increases leaving the centre

How do you calculate the angle and Mach number ($M_{2}$) at the middle of a detached shock?

Back: 
- Centre is an normal shock, hence $\beta=0$ and $\theta=0$
- Mach number can be calculated using normal shock table or relevant normal shock equation

State where each of the labelled locations lie on a oblique shock chart. Stating properties of the points that are distict.

Back: 
- This is a detached shock

![[Pasted image 20231117005059.png]]
- $a=$ flow inline with the tip, it is where the angle is $90\degree$ and is equivalent to a [[normal shock properties equations|normal shock]] 
- $b=$ occurs between $a$ and $c$, here you'll find the maximum [[oblique shock angles|turning angle]] if comparing to a [[oblique shocks|oblique shock table]]
- $c=$ this is the point on the surface where $M_{2}=1$, beyond which flow past the detached shock will be supersonic
- $d=$ around here are [[oblique shock chart|weak solutions]]
- $e=$ here a Mach wave occurs as you get really far from the object

How do points along a detached shock relate to oblique shocks.

Back: 
- What makes these nasty is unlike normal shocks or oblique shocks which have single angles they operate at, detached shocks form a curved surface meaning different turning angles ($\beta$) across the entire surface leading to very complex behaviour ($M_{2}$ varies across the whole surface).
- Effectively, we can treat any point on the detached shock as an instantaneous oblique shock, given $\beta$ at that point: oblique shock methods can find $M_{2}$ and $\theta$
