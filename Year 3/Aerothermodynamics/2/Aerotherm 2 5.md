For the following, how would you go about calculating lift and drag, give only a high level analysis. State the order key values are found.

Back: 
- For lift and drag the $M_{3}$ values aren't needed
- Initial stagnation pressure $P_{01}$ can be found from pressure and isentropic flow tables

State the 3 equations of pressure coefficient.

Back: 
$$ C_{p} = \frac{p-p_{\infty}}{p_{0}-p_{\infty}} =  \frac{p-p_{\infty}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}V^{2}_{\infty}} = \frac{2}{\gamma M^{2}_{\infty}} \left(\frac{p}{p_{\infty}} - 1\right) $$

A supersonic flow travels over a angled flat plate, where is the centre of pressure and aerodynamic centre? Why?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20231218131932.png]]
- The centre of pressure's pretty easy to figure out intuitively, it will be at $c=0.5$ since the pressure is constant on the upper and lower surfaces.
- The [[aerodynamic centre]] is equally trivial, since the [[centre of pressure]] is constant we know the [[aerodynamic centre]] must be located at the same spot ($c=0.5$).
- This is quite different to what we generally see in normal aerofoils

Why is there drag, even though we have the inviscid assumption, for supersonic flows?

Back: 
- In supersonic flows, even with the inviscid assumption, drag is present due to the generation of shock waves. These shock waves lead to changes in pressure, density, and temperature, causing an increase in drag.
- The shocks involved generally produce entropy even in the case of the inviscid assumption, leading to the generation of useful energy losses and hence drag
