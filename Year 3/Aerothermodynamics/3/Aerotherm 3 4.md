State Crocco's theorem, what are it's implications in simplified flows?

Back: 
$$\begin{align*} T \frac{dS}{dn} &= \frac{dh_{0}}{dn} +u \omega  \end{align*}$$
- This equation relates specific entropy $S$ change with streamline width $n$, under the conditions of other variables.
- What this equation shows is that If stagnation enthalpy is constant everywhere and the flow is irrotational and steady (greatly simplified flow), then the entropy is constant everywhere ([[homentropic flow]]).

$$\begin{align*} T \frac{dS}{dn} &= \frac{dh_{0}}{dn} +u \omega &&\to& T \frac{dS}{dn} &= 0 +0 &&\to&  \frac{dS}{dn} &= 0\end{align*}$$
