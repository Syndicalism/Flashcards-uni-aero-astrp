What is a P-n diagram, describe it and sketch it

Back: 
- This is very similar to a v-n diagram, instead of plotting (velocity, load factor) we now plot (velocity, tail lift)
- An expression relating tail lift, velocity and load factor can easily be defined
- Since $C_{m0}$ is (usually) negative, the resulting diagram gets depressed

> ### $$\begin{align*}  P &= n\frac{ a  W}{a+l} + V^{2} \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho S \bar{c} C_{m0} }{a+l} &&\to& P&= \beta_{1} n + \beta_{2} V^{2} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $P=$ tail lift
>> $V=$ velocity
>> $l=$ distance between tail and main wing centres of lift
>> $a=$ distance between main wing centre of lift and centre of mass
>> $n=$ [[load factor]]
>> $W=$ aircraft weight
>> $C_{m0}=$ [[pitching moment coefficient]]
>> $\bar{c}=$ [[Mean chord|mean aerodynamic chord]]
>> $\rho=$ atmospheric density

Briefly describe how gusts effect load factor

Back: 
- Anything that causes upward/downward acceleration will create a load factor. This is where gusts come in, a gust in the horizontal or vertical direction will effect load factor:
- In the horizontal direction, it will lead to an effective increase/decrease in airspeed, which will change lift effecting load factor
- In the vertical direction it effectively changes AOA which changes lift and hence load factor

Quickly derive the relationship between load factor and change in lift due to gusts.

Back: 
$$\begin{align*}
n &= \frac{L+\Delta L+P+\Delta P}{W} &&\to& n &= \frac{L+P}{W} + \frac{\Delta L+\Delta P}{W}  &&\to& n &= 1 + \frac{\Delta L+\Delta P}{W}
\end{align*}$$

What is this, explain what it means:
$$\begin{align*}
n &= 1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho UV \frac{1}{W/S} \frac{dC_{L}}{d\alpha} 
\end{align*}$$

Back: 
- This is an equation relating load factor to gust speed, where $U$ is vertical gust speed

- Gust induced [[load factor]] is:
	- Proportional to aircraft speed
	- Proportional to gust speed
	- Inversely proportional to [[wing loading]]

- We can see that if we want to reduce the load factor to reduce the risk to structure in heavy turbulence we can:
	- Decrease speed
	- Increase wing loading (may be more difficult in flight)
