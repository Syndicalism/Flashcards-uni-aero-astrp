What is aeroelastic tailoring.

Back: 
- Aeroelastic tailoring is where you make use of the directional properties of composites to ensure that deflection occurs in ways that are beneficial for aerodynamic performance under expected loads. For instance to prevent wing twisting.

What is the problem with joining composites? How to mitigate?

Back: 
- In aircraft structures composites are generally stiffer than metals, so from an engineering standpoint, the composite carries most of the loads.
- This imbalance, increases risk of delamination (thermal exp mismatch is also cringe)
- Joining composites also requires glue or holes which delaminate or crease stress concentration
- Mitigation can be increasing amount of compoisites, or decreasing joining points having more integrated designs
