Define:
- Longeron
- Stringer
- Strut

Back: 
- In an aircraft fuselage, stringers are attached to formers (also called frames) and run in the longitudinal direction of the aircraft. 
- They are primarily responsible for transferring the aerodynamic loads acting on the skin onto the frames and formers. 
- In the wings or horizontal stabilizer, longerons run spanwise (from wing root to wing tip) and attach between the ribs. 
- The primary function here also is to transfer the bending loads acting on the wings onto the ribs and spar.

What is the torsion box, what does it do, sketch it.

Back: 
- The core of a wing can be seen to hold a box like structure, this design helps resist torsion.

What is a spar? Describe its position, shape and function.

Back: 
- run spanwise throughout the wing. 
- carry vertical shear forces acting on the wing 
- form part of the wing torsion box. Wing spars in modern aircraft are machined from thick plates of aluminium alloy and have flanges or booms at the top and bottom edges.
- carry the direct bending stresses due to the wing bending moments
- they help attach the skins to the spar web

What is skin, what forces must it withstand, what other considerations are required?

Back: 
- This is the outer surface which is directly exposed to aerodynamic effects:
- It must withstand the normal and tangential forces acting on the surface (eg pressure and skin drag)
- It must retain it's aerodynamic shape and be smooth
- Withstand shear and deformation under wing bending
- Withstand a high degree of cyclic loading
- Resists buckling
- Aircraft skin experiences a wide variety of loading conditions depending on it's location and aircraft attitude.

What are stringers, what are their other names, what is their role?

Back: 
- These are spanwise members which are attached to the skin.
- Alternative name stiffener
- The role of stringers is to carry tensile and compressive loads which arise in wing bending. 
- They act to stabilise the skin against buckling when it is subjected to a compressive load.
- They achieve this by dividing the skin into relatively narrow "strips" which have an increased buckling load.
- As the stringers are fairly long, they will themselves buckle unless they are supported at frequent intervals. This is one of the roles of the wing ribs.

How do we attach panels to achieve crack retardation?

Back: 
- We avoid stress concentration created by irregular geometry

Crack stopper, how

Back: 
- a crack stopper is a separate strip of material bonded to the surface of a spar:
- When a crack approaches it the increased material area reduces the load, impeding crack growth
- The separation of the materials makes it difficult for the crack to propagate into the stopper
- The crack stopper effectively holds the material together

- Failure load
- Proof load
- Proof factor
- Ultimate load
- Ultimate factor
- Reserve factor
- Margin of safety

>> where:
>> $F_{L}=$ Limit load, the maximum load the structure will experience over it's anticipated service life. This provides an indication of the maximum loads that the structure is designed for.
>> $F_{F}=$ Failure load, the maximum sustainable load before failure
>> $F_{P}=$ Proof load, the structure must be able to withstand the proof load without permanent deformation
>> $\mu_{P}=$ proof factor, the factor relating proof load to limit load. Typically this is either 1 or 1.25
>> $F_{U}=$ ultimate load, failure doesn't occur at the design ultimate load. The ultimate factor is typically 1.5. Ensure that $F_{U}<F_{F}$ such that we have absolute certainty $F_{U}$ is safe.
>> $\mu_{U}=$ ultimate factor,  the factor relating ultimate load to limit load
>> $R_{f}=$ reserve factor
>> $M_{S}=$ Margin of safety, this is similar to but different from safety factor
