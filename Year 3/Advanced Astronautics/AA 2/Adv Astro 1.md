Two flat disks of identical dimensions exist in a otherwise empty vacuum. Disk A is provided with constant heating $\dot{Q}$ such that it's temperature is 150C. Draw the Oppenheim network for it, stating key relationships. Then derive the set of equations you'd need to solve.

State the resistance in an Oppenheim network for:
- A real node to a fake node
- Between fake nodes


Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
R_{real} &= A_{x} \frac{\varepsilon_{x}}{1-\varepsilon_{x}} &&& R_{fake} &= A_{a} F_{a\to b} \\&&&&&= A_{b} F_{b\to a}
\end{align} $$
