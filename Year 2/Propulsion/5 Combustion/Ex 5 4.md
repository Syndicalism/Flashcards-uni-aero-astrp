What does it mean for a air fuel mixture to be stoichiometric?

Back: 
- There is exactly as much air needed for complete combustion (no deficiency or excess)

A fuel mixture is stochiometric, will complete combustion occur? Why?

Back: 
- Not necessarily, sufficient oxygen is just the minimum requirement for complete combustion. There are other factors that influence it.
- It would actually be difficult for complete combustion to occur without very thorough mixing.

State the name of the following variable and it's equation:
$$ \begin{align}
\phi
\end{align} $$

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\phi &\equiv \frac{\text{AFR}_{st}}{\text{AFR}} = \frac{\text{n}_{air,st}}{\text{n}_{air}}
\end{align} $$
- It is the equivalence ratio
- It describes the ratio between the stochiometric air fuel ratio and the current air fuel ratio

What does $\phi<1$ mean?

Back: 
- $\phi$ is the equivalence ratio
- $\phi<1$ means the current air fuel ratio is greater than the stochiometric air fuel ratio
- This means that the mixture is fuel lean

END_CARD

START_CARD
Basic

What does $\phi>1$ mean?

Back: 
- $\phi$ is the equivalence ratio
- $\phi>1$ means the current air fuel ratio is less than the stochiometric air fuel ratio
- This means that the mixture is fuel rich

END_CARD



--------

START_CARD
Basic

What does $\phi=1$ mean?

Back: 
- $\phi$ is the equivalence ratio
- $\phi=1$ means the current air fuel ratio is at the stochiometric air fuel ratio
- This means that the mixture has the exact amount of air needed for complete combustion

END_CARD

Basic

What does $\phi=0$ mean?

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\phi &= \frac{\text{AFR}_{st}}{\text{AFR}}
\end{align} $$
- $\phi$ is the equivalence ratio
- $\phi=0$ means either//
- This means that the mixture is fuel rich

Why do we construct a 3 stage process model for adiabatic  combustion?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230412182659.png]]
- During combustion the actual properties of the gas changes (from reactants to products)
- This makes doing maths hellish
- Instead of suffering we use tabulated data on heat production
- These tabulated values only apply at a specific temperature (in our case usually $T_{0}=25C$)
- So we have 2 processes just going between the actual temp and this $T_{0}$, then one process is the actual burning

What are the 3 stages in the model we use for adiabatic combustion?

Back: 
![[Pasted image 20230412182659.png]]
- We change the reactants temperature to the reference temperature
- We perform isothermal combustion and the reactants become the product
- We add back the heat that was removed to get to the reference temperature

$$ \begin{align}
\dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{x} &= \sum\limits_\text{react} \dot m_{i} (h_{i,0} - h_{i,1}) - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} + \sum\limits_\text{prod} \dot m_{j} (h_{j,2}  - h_{j,0})
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- State what it is and what it's used for
- Name it's variables

Back: 
- This is the steady flow energy equation applied over a adiabatic combustion model, we use it to calculate temp change over a combustion process
- $\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat addition
- $\dot{W}_{x}$ is the rate of heat extraction
- $\dot m_{i}$ is the mass flow of one of the reactants
- $h_{i,0}$ is the entropy of one of the reactants at the reference state before isentropic combustion
- $h_{i,1}$ is the entropy of one of the reactants at the very start
- $\dot m_{f}$ is the mass flow of the fuel that is being burned
- $\text{LCV}$ is the lower calorific value of the fuel being burned (for that particular reference temp $T_{0}$)
- $\dot m_{j}$ is the mass flow of one of the products
- $h_{j,0}$ is the entropy of one of the products at the reference state after isentropic combustion
- $h_{j,2}$ is the entropy of one of the products at the very end

How do we get something useful from this:
$$ \begin{align}
\dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{x} &= \sum\limits_\text{react} \dot m_{i} (h_{i,0} - h_{i,1}) - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} + \sum\limits_\text{prod} \dot m_{j} (h_{j,2}  - h_{j,0})
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- First of all we (almost) never add heat or do work during combustion so $\dot{Q}=0$ and $\dot{W}_{x}=0$
- Since temperature change is what we care about we'll assume a perfect gas and use the relationship $\Delta h=c_{p} \Delta T$ so:
$$ \begin{align}
\dot{Q} - \dot{W}_{x} = \sum\limits_\text{react} \dot m_{i} (h_{i,0} - h_{i,1})& - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} + \sum\limits_\text{prod} \dot m_{j} (h_{j,2}  - h_{j,0})\\
&\downarrow\\
0 = \sum\limits_\text{react} \dot m_{i} c_{p,i} (T_{i,0} - T_{i,1})& - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} + \sum\limits_\text{prod} \dot m_{j} c_{p,j} (T_{j,2}  - T_{j,0})
\end{align} $$
- Also we will only be adding one mass of "reactants" and one mass of "products" so we can remove the sum. Note that the mass of the products and reactants will be the same:
$$ \begin{align}
0 = \sum\limits_\text{react} \dot m_{i} c_{p,i} (T_{i,0} - T_{i,1})& - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} + \sum\limits_\text{prod} \dot m_{j} c_{p,j} (T_{j,2}  - T_{j,0})\\
&\downarrow\\
0 = \dot m  c_{p,r} (T_{r,0} - T_{r,1})& - \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV} +  \dot m  c_{p,p} (T_{p,2}  - T_{p,0})\\
&\downarrow\:(\text{rearrange})\\
\frac{\dot m  c_{p,r} ( T_{r,1} - T_{r,0} ) + \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV}}{\dot m  c_{p,p}} & + T_{p,0} =  T_{p,2}  
\end{align} $$
- This is useful but we may want to change it to be interms of air fuel ratio:
$$ \begin{align}
\frac{\dot m c_{p,r} ( T_{r,1} - T_{r,0} ) + \dot{m}_{f} \text{LCV}}{\dot m  c_{p,p}}   + T_{p,0} &=  T_{p,2}\\
\downarrow\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:&\\
\frac{  c_{p,r} ( T_{r,1} - T_{r,0} ) + \frac{1}{1+\text{AFR}} \text{LCV}}{  c_{p,p}}   + T_{p,0}& =  T_{p,2}  
\end{align} $$

$$ \begin{align}
K^{\theta} = \frac{(p_{CO_{2}}) \sqrt{p^{\theta}} }{(p_{CO}) \sqrt{p_{O_{2}}}}
\end{align} $$

For this equation:
- state it's corresponding reaction
- describe how it's applied
- state what it describes 
- name it's variables

Back: 

- The equation describes the relationship between the pressures of the products and reactions in equilibrium. This particular form would refer to the generic chemical equation:
$$ \begin{align}
\ce{a CO + b O_{2} &<=> c CO_{2}}
\end{align} $$
- This equation can be used to determine the ratio of products to reactants when the ratio is otherwise undefined 
- $a,b,c$ is the mol's of the species $a,b,c$ in the reaction
- $p^{\theta}$ is the pressure at a reference value (usually $p^{\theta} = 1\text{bar}$)
- $p_{?}$ is the partial pressure of each species
- $K^{\theta}$ is the equilibrium constant for this particular reaction

Given that the pressure ($p$) and temperature ($T$) is known, convert the following into a useful form:

$$ \begin{align}
K^{\theta} = \frac{(p_{CO_{2}}) \sqrt{p^{\theta}} }{(p_{CO}) \sqrt{p_{O_{2}}}}
\end{align} $$

Back: 
$$ \begin{align}
\ce{a CO + b O_{2} &<=> c CO_{2}}
\end{align} $$

- We know that partial pressures are proportional to their molar faction, so:
$$ \begin{align}
t &= a+b+c & p_{CO} &= p\frac{a}{t} & p_{O_{2}} &= p\frac{b}{t} & p_{CO_{2}} &= p\frac{c}{t}
\end{align} $$
- Also we know that by working in bar $p^{\theta}=1$
- Subbing these in:
$$ \begin{align}
K^{\theta} &= \frac{(p_{CO_{2}}) \sqrt{p^{\theta}} }{(p_{CO}) \sqrt{p_{O_{2}}}} & &\to & K^{\theta} &= \frac{p\frac{c}{t} \sqrt{1} }{p\frac{a}{t} \sqrt{p\frac{b}{t}}}\\
&& && K^{\theta} &= \frac{ c }{a }\sqrt{\frac{a+b+c}{pb}}
\end{align} $$
