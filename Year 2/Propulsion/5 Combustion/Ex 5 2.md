What is atmospheric nitrogen. Why do we use it?

Back: 
- Atmospheric nitrogen ($N^{*}_{2}$) is equivilent to the typical gas composition of air minus oxygen
- Air is ~79% nitrogen and ~21% oxygen with some tiny amount of other misc gas
- Practically everything other than oxygen in air doesn't really do much in most chemical reactions that we need to care about so it's convenient to just group nitrogen+other together and call it "atmospheric nitrogen"
- Hence $N^{*}_{2} \neq N_{2}$, the properties are very slightly different (but I mean it's pretty close ngl)

State the chemical bit that should go in "air":

$$ \begin{align}
CH_{4} + \text{air} &\to\:\: ... 
\end{align} $$

Back: 

$$ \begin{align}
CH_{4} + \left(O_{2} + \frac{79}{21} N^{*}_{2}\right) &\to\:\: ... 
\end{align} $$

State the definition of air fuel ratio.

Back: 
- The ratio of the mass of air to mass of fuel.

$$ \begin{align}
\text{AFR} &= \frac{m_{a}}{m_{f}} = \frac{\dot{m}_{a}}{\dot{m}_{f}}
\end{align} $$
