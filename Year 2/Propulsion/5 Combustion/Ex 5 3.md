TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::5 Combustion


START_CARD
Basic

State the combustion products for the following, assuming complete combustion:

$$ \begin{align}
CH_{4} + 2O_{2} &\to\:\:... 
\end{align} $$

Back: 

$$ \begin{align}
CH_{4} + 2O_{2} &\to CO_{2} + 2 H_{2} O  
\end{align} $$

Is the following complete combustion, why?

$$ \begin{align}
CH_{4} + 2O_{3} &\to CO_{2} + 2H_{2} O + O_{2} 
\end{align} $$

Back: 
- Yes it is complete combustion
- Incomplete combustion is when either fuel is left or incomplete exhaust products are left (commonly pure carbon or carbon monoxide)
- Since all carbon is in $CO_{2}$ it's clearly complete

State 2 possible reasons for incomplete combustion.

Back: 
- Insufficient oxygen is available for the mass of fuel
- The air and fuel is not mixed sufficiently
- The temperature/pressure/flow velocity is not appropriate
