TARGET_DECK: Propulsion::9 Turbomachinery part 1



START_CARD
Basic

The function of a blade in axial turbomachinery is to add/use swirl, what gradient drives this?

Back: 
- The pressure gradient between suction and pressure surfaces of adjacent blades is what's responsible for flow velocity changes

Describe the expected pressures on this compressor rotor. Then describe how that interacts with flow to change static entropy.

Back: 
- The rotor in the image will be moving upward
- This will lead to the bottom of the blade having a low pressure and the top of the blade having a high pressure
- The pressure gradient accelerates the flow towards the axial direction and the stream tube experiences increasing cross sectional area
- The increasing area leads to flow deceleration and static enthalpy and pressure increase.

Describe the expected pressures on this turbine rotor. Then describe how that interacts with flow to change static entropy.

Back: 
- This turbine blade is moving upwards
- The extreme camber along with the angle of the incident stream creates a high pressure on the bottom of the blade and low pressure ontop
- This pressure gradient pushes the turbine upwards (extracting energy from the gas)
- The flow is turned away from the axial direction imparting negative swirl, at the same time the cross section of the stream tubes are decreasing
- This leads to the flow accelerating and loosing static enthalpy and pressure

What can be done to a compressor to reduce the risk of boundary layer separation? What is a disadvantage of each approach?

Back: 
- Decreasing the gap between pressure and suction surfaces in a stage can reduce separation risk, this is done by increasing blade count.
	- Increases weight
	- Increases complexity
- Reduce pressure gradient across individual stages but increase number of stages.
	- Increases weight
	- Increases complexity

What is compressor stall? What can cause it?

Back: 
- This is where stall occurs across some of the blades in the compressor, leading to potentially significant lost performance.
- It can be caused by:
	- Flow rate being too low
	- Rotation speed being too high
