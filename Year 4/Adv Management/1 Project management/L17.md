Basic

Sketch out and describe a precedence table.

Back: 
- These are simple table representations of the dependence relationships between tasks
- A good starting point for generating the task network

Describe the 2 forms of duration estimation in a activity network

Back: 
- Deterministic estimation
	- Each activity has a fixed duration, with total project duration being the critical path length
	- Non critical activities can be delayed without impact to project length (so long as the delay remains below the critical path)

- Stochastic estimation
	- Activity durations are pdfs
	- Total duration is now a probability distribution
	- Critical paths are likely not certain, paths have some chance of being critical
	- Lots of monte carlo analysis is used

Basic

State the duration of the critical path in this activity network.

Back: 
- Duration is $10+5+12+3 = 30$

How would you estimate duration for the following, where $(\mu,\sigma)$. Additionally comment on the properties of the critical path.

![[Pasted image 20241224105220.png]]

Back: 
- Monte Carlo analysis, which in this case produces the following PDFs for the two paths
- We can see that there is no "certain critical path" although in this case path B is more likely to be the critical path
- Project duration may be described interms of percentiles with paths being described in their probabilities of being critical

START_CARD
Basic

State all methods for reducing critical path, briefly describing them.

Back: 
1) Elimination of path critical tasks - Unnecessary tasks can be eliminated or possibly moved to another path which has the slack to accommodate it
2) Move serial paths to become parallel
3) Laddering - Overlap sequential tasks so they begin before their prerequisites completely finished
4) Shorten the duration of path critical tasks - can be simplification or application of additional resources (eg: overtime)
5) Shorten early tasks - Immediate tasks have less uncertainty, providing confidence on the effects of shortening them
6) Shorten long tasks - Often difficult to do, due to scheduling problems
7) Shorten easy tasks - Identify tasks which have too many resources considering their difficulty
8) Shorten tasks which can be most easily accelerated - Some tasks may lend themselfs to being accelerated more easily than others, these are where additional resources should be directed first

What is project crashing?

Back: 
- This is the process of accelerating a project
- It relates to increasing resource commitment to push the project to faster completion

END_CARD


--------

START_CARD
Basic

State 3 possible reasons for crashing

Back: 
- An initially too aggressive schedule – crashing is inevitable
- Demand for earlier completion due to changing market needs
- The project has slipped behind schedule
- Contractual situation provides an incentive not to slip delivery

START_CARD
Basic

State and describe 4 methods for accelerating a project.

Back: 
1) Improve project resource productivity - Find more effecient ways to work, possibly by eliminating barriers for productivity (bureaucracy)
2) Change working method - Altering the tech and type of resources employed
3) Reduce project scope - less scope, less features, less work
4) Overtime - lol
5) Allocation of additional resources - Can be more workers or some expensive form of automation

Comment on brooks law, and its mitigation.

Back: 
- "Adding resources to ongoing activities only delays them further"
- Reworking a ongoing project simply disrupts its flow, additional workers means current workers need to bring them upto speed
- To avoid this trap, when additional resources are allocated must be considered, often this means waiting till the next task starts to onboard new workers

What is agile project management? 

Back: 
- Agile project management is a flexible, iterative approach to managing projects. 
- It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, frequent releases to adapt quickly to changes. 
- Agile breaks projects into smaller cycles called sprints, allowing teams to deliver value incrementally and continuously improve throughout the process.

Comment on the problems with agile.

Back: 
- Collaboration through the scrum team can be time-consuming requiring a commitment from all involved
- Evolving requirements can lead to scope creep – a never-ending series of requested changes
- Difficult to predict what the product will look like at the end and therefore make an effective business case
- Testing is performed throughout the project – this adds costs as in a non-agile approach these are only required at the end
- Applying it to the wrong project i.e. one with a high level of predictability can lead to increased costs

Comment on resource loading visualisation and its implications in optimal scheduling.

Back: 
- A resource loading chart may be used to visualise the distribution of resources over the project lifetime
- Generally we want to keep these distributions as flat as possible (as some resources (workforce) may be fixed)
