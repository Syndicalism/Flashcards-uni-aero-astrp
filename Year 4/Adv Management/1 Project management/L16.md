State the 4 main uncertainty types present in project operations, and their characteristics

Back: 
1) Ambiguity uncertainty - caused by lack of knowledge, can be in the specification or lack of data. Is generally reduced over time as more info becomes available.
2) Inherent variability - Inherent variation expected within certain factors, for instance the variation of inflation.
3) Event uncertainty - Events that may or may not occur. 
4) Systemic uncertainty - Dependencies so complex that the systems practically random.

All of these will generally decrease to some extent as the deadline approaches and the degree to which they can vary reduces.

Define PUMP, and give a brief comment on their contents

Back: 
- Performance Uncertainty Management Process
- This is a framework for capturing uncertainties, determining their impacts, help make decisions and identify possible opportunities
- They use stochastic processes present in PERT (Programme Evaluation and Review Technique) with monte carlo methods
- Includes decision branches, sensitivity diagrams, the effects of documentation, etc

What are the five tasks to all seven pump phases.

Back: 
- Document - record stuff: text, tables, diagrams
- Verify - confirm all record agree with eachother, identify where this isn't possible
- Asses - Evaluate the analysis performed so far, ensuring it's fit for purpose
- Report - Release resulting documents and present findings
- Fit for purpose iteration control - from the report, asses if the current deliverables are fit for purpose

State what phase 6 of PUMP is, and what it's goal is.

Back: 
- Phase 6 is Quantification, this aims to provide probability estimates on the uncertainty associated with the previously identified sources of uncertainty and their associated response options
- Probability estimates can be: cost, duration or some other resource/performance criteria
- The quantified estimates are required to allow informed choices in the design of the project, such that it's resilient to risk and/or can exploit uncertain opportunities

State the general strategy used to complete phase 6 of PUMP

Back: 
- Phase 6 - Quantification
- The goal is to size the sources of uncertainty, we do this by iteratively building models on gathered information
- We iterate until clarity is achieved in the context of our PUMP objectives
- We allocate increased effort only where it's useful, aka: we disregard detailed modelling for sources of error determined to be insignificant
- We may use previous phases where sources of error where ranked prior to modelling, to skip quantification entirely where appropriate

State what the PIG is, and its issues. Briefly compare this with PUMP.

Back: 
- Probability Impact Grid
- It is a somewhat subjective method for determining the importance of a risk, where you roughly quantify importance based on the (impact caused by failure) x (likelihood of failure)
- Problems:
	- Very simple quantification of risk, which lacks clarity (eg: when the risk occurs)
	- Definitions of likelihood and impact are generally vague and subjective
	- Context is often lost in these "quantifications"
	- Information on feeding factors are generally lost

- PUMP quantification aims to avoid ambiguity by providing numerical reliability models, this also removes much of the subjectivity

State the 5 key steps for PUMP quantification.

Back: 
1) Ordering uncertainty sources in terms of importance
2) Clarifying associated conditions for these uncertainties e.g. this will only happen ifâ€¦
3) Data or elicitation is used to size the uncertainty e.g. produce a PDF
4) Refine sizing e.g., alternative PDF definitions, management of elicitation, clarification of relationships between objective data and subjective probabilities
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each uncertainty in the list updating priorities if necessary are more information comes to light

What is elicitation. Describe it's process.

Back: 
- This is the process of extracting the data required for sizing the uncertainty in a step, in a context where detailed data may not exist. Effectively this is getting a (very) informed guess, using some expert(s)
- We ask for estimates on the likelihood of certain simple scenario outcomes, eg: likelihood of pessimistic case, optimistic case, intermediate cases. These are framed in terms that humans can easily work with, such as "chance that 90% fail"
- The scenarios used do not directly ask for estimates on PDF parameters, as humans suck at stating these. Max and min bounds tend to be a frequent choice.
- We attempt to work in some factor to reduce the impact of human bias, humans tend to underestimate uncertainty
- These values can then be used to shape a PDF, often simple triangular or rectangular distributions work best (more complex model doesn't necessarily mean better!)

Describe what occurs in phase 7 of PUMP. Stating its main stages.

Back: 
- This is the evaluation step
- The PDFs that have been sized in the quantification phase are now combined
- This is then used to inform decision making
- This phase, therefore, includes the presentation & interpretation of results
- All of this is bearing in mind the objectives, assumptions, conditions etc. identified as part of earlier phases of the PUMP

Stages are;
1. Defining an appropriate starting point based on source dependencies
2. Specifying dependence between sources
3. Combining sources using mathematical operators
4. Presenting the results of the model
5. Diagnosing the implications of these results
